(Harder) Implement the function log2, which computes the integer log (base 2) of its argument. That is, log2 computes the exponent of the largest power of 2 which is less than or equal to its argument. For example, log2 16 = 4, log2 11 = 3, and log2 1 = 0. (Small hint: read the last phrase of the paragraph immediately preceding these exercises.)

-- TODO
-- You may have noticed when you were playing with the hangman
-- game, that there are some weird things about its game logic:

-- [ ] although it can play with words up to 9 characters long, you only
-- get to guess 7 characters;
-- [ ] it ends the game after 7 guesses, whether they were correct or
-- incorrect;
-- [ ] if your 7th guess supplies the last letter in the word, it may still
-- tell you you lost;
-- [ ] it picks some very strange words that you didnâ€™t suspect were
-- even in the dictionary.

-- These make it unlike hangman as you might have played it in the past.
-- Ordinarily, only incorrect guesses count against you, so you can make
-- as many correct guesses as you need to fill in the word. Modifying
-- the game so that it either gives you more guesses before the game
-- ends or only uses shorter words (or both) involves only a couple of
-- uncomplicated steps.
-- A bit more complicated but worth attempting as an exercise is changing
-- the game so that, as with normal hangman, only incorrect guesses
-- count towards the guess limit.

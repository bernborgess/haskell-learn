-- Monad transformers
-- The last chapter demonstrated why we need monad transformers and
-- the basic type manipulation that’s going on to make that
-- bit o’ magick happen.

-- Monad transformers are important in a lot of everyday
-- Haskell code, though, so we want to dive deeper and make
-- sure we have a good understanding of how to use them in practice

-- Even after you know how to write all the transformer instances,
-- managing stacks of transformers in an application can be tricky.

-- The goal of this chapter is to get comfortable with it.

-- In this chapter, we will

-- * work through more monad transformer types and instances;

-- * look at the ordering and wrapping of monad transformer stacks;

-- * lift, lift, lift, and lift some more.
